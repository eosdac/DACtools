# Purpose
Tool to script the airdrop process to EOS accounts.

# Caution
Use this script at your own risk. I have tested the script multiple times on the jungletestnetwork with the genesis snapshot as input data without issues. 
We at eosDAC also dropped our tokens on the mainnet with this script. I strongly advice to do numerous test runs on the testnetwork before even attempting doing 
a drop on the mainnet. You really should know how the script works.

# Technical Details
Tool allows you to practice with practice runs and encourages it on the jungle testnet before mainnet implementation. The Drop object is created from dropper.js and it allows you to run through a mysql that is predefined with the snapshot which the developer has previously generated.
